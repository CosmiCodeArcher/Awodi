            <p className="mb-4 text-sm md:text-base">
                Hello! I&apos;m Awodi, a passionate web developer with a focus on creating 
                responsive and user-friendly web applications. With a strong foundation in 
                modern web technologies, I&apos;m constantly pushing myself to learn and grow in 
                this ever-evolving field.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
                My journey in web development began from the intimidation and ambition i felt when 
                i saw lines of code for the first time, 
                seeing that a human was handling this magnificent sight. Since then, I&apos;ve immersed 
                myself in the world of coding, completing intensive online courses and building 
                numerous projects. Through this process, I&apos;ve developed a particular interest in
                React.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-sm md:text-base">
                My technical toolkit includes:
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                    <li>React</li>
                    <li>Vite</li>
                    <li>Tailwind</li>
                    <li>Python</li>
                    <li>Web Sockets</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
                I&apos;ve built over 40 web applications, each one teaching me valuable lessons 
                about code structure, user experience, and problem-solving.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
                When I&apos;m not coding, you can find me immersing myself in various arts. I find 
                that these activities complement my development work by enhancing my mindset and
                creativity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking ahead, I&apos;m excited to dive further into React Technologies like Next.Js.
                I&apos;m always open to new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer.
            </p>
